## 

Create items that can be thrown at you, sounds that can be played, and trigger VTube studio. All using events from twitch such as redeems, commands, subscriptions, follows, raids, bits

Still early stages and work in progress, but it does work and throwables / sounds can be created then triggered by events.

Aiming to be a tailored and improved version of [KBonk](https://github.com/typeou/karasubonk) more suited to my needs and wants.

## Custom Commands

Write custom commands using JavaScript powered by `deno_core`

## Sounds 

Sounds, play custom sounds when events occur. Can be used to create sound alerts. Sounds can also be attached to throwable items to
play the sound upon impact
